week-4

- obesity and happiness is contagious

- How do we choose company
	- selection
		- we like to be with people who are like us
	- social influence
		- we become like people we like to be with

- similarity measure
	- ratio b/w favourates of both vs common favourates

- wikipedia example
	- people gain similarity and then become friends, after thar the similarity gaining rate slows down (selection is more than social influence)


- homophili
	- if 100 ppl, 50 teens, 50 middle age, now we can say there is homophili if
		- no. of friends accross / total no. of friends is very low
		- or no. of friends accross is < (total no. of friends/2)
	- we calculate homophili as
		- 1-(no. of friends accross is / (total no. of friends/2))
		- or 1 - (actual/expected)
			- if this no. is +ve then more is homophili
			- if this no. is -ve then more is heterophili(ball room example)

- focul closure
	- if A & B go to a place C regularly, then A & B become friends
		- ex. two people meet at yoga club and become friends

- membership closure
	- if A & B are friends and A goes to a place regularly whare he has fun, he will take B with him
		- A takes B to his gym

- two people with k common friends:
	- if p=probability of two becoming friends when they have a common friend
	- then, (1-p) is probability of them not becoming friends when they have 1 common friend
	- (1-p)<sup>k</sup> is probability of not being friends when having k common friends
	- 1-(1-p)<sup>k</sup> is probability of being friends when having k common friends
	- here p is of the level 0.002
