- if we have any connected graph, and we do a random walk, then it will take approximately O(n) to trasvere the whole graph
- ranking strategies
	- (equal sharing)if we give every node a 100 coins, then make them share their coins equially with to the one they point to, then we will get a ranking with respect to how many coins each have
	- (random dropping)if we random walk in a node dropping some number of coins, the coins accumulated in all the nodes after a certain walk will give ranking equal to the above ranking mechanism
	- GNU - GNU's Not Unix
	- you are famous if famous people say you are famous, if they don't call famous to many people
