week-12

- programming
	- make small world network
		- 2d
			- make a mesh like 100*100 with homophili
			- add some weak ties
		- 1d
			- make a ring, with every node connected to 2 nodes to either side
			- next we rewire nodes with random nodes
			- we will learn, on rewiring, how much does max shortest path reduces (diameter)


- k core
	- if a subgraph has every node with atleast k degrees then, it is a k core.
